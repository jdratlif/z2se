- Introduction -
----------------

  Zelda II SRAM Editor is a tool for editing Zelda II save state files used
  with NES emulators.
  
  Instead of taking an emulator dependent save file such as Nesticle states or
  FCEU states, this program works on the emulator independent SRAM files which
  are used by the game internally and will therefore work on any emulator.
  
  These SRAM files are generally named the same as the ROM with a .sav
  extention. For example, "Zelda II - The Adventure of Link (U).sav" is one
  possible example.
  
----------------
- Installation -
----------------

  For Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, I have provided a binary version. You should
  be able to download the binary and run the program by double-clicking the
  executable.
  
  For Windows, all the necessary files are included in the binary archive. For
  the Linux binary, you will need GTK+ 2.0.
  
  To compile the source, you will require an ISO standard C++ compiler. I
  recommend g++ 3.3 or later. I used mingw-g++ 3.4.2 for Windows. You will
  also need wxWidgets 2.6 to compile from source.
  
  Once you have wxWidgets installed, you should be able to do something like:
  
  ./configure && make
  
  This should produce an executable z2se (z2se.exe on Windows). Contact me if
  you have problems building the source.
  
---------
- Usage -
---------

  Using the program should (I hope) be fairly straightforward. Start the program
  z2se either by double-clicking or from the command line.
  
  Load the SRAM .sav file. For FCEU on Windows, this is in the FCEU directory
  in the SAV subdirectory. For FCEU on Unix, this is in the ~/.fceu directory. I
  don't know about other emulators because I don't use them. The program should
  work on any emulator that uses the battery backed RAM (SRAM), which nearly
  all modern ones do.
  
  Once the file is open, it will load the game. If the SRAM file is not valid,
  or doesn't have a save game, the program will inform you and not load
  anything. Since Zelda II did not use a checksum value, it is possible to
  load an invalid file which will result in unpredictable behavior.
  
  Most everything is editable. If you feel something is missing, or want to see
  something else in the program, contact me and maybe I'll add it.
  
  When you load a .SAV file, it will make a backup in a file named the same as
  your SRAM file with a .bak on the end. If something goes wrong when you try
  to start your edited game, just delete the SRAM file and rename the backup to
  .sav instead of .sav.bak. Note that if you load the SRAM file, make changes,
  and load it again, you will lose the original backup. Personally, it wouldn't
  hurt to make a backup copy of your SRAM file before editing it if your
  original is important to you. Though I have complete faith in the program,
  better safe than sorry.

- Notes -
---------

  Some important things to be aware of.
  
  - This is BETA software. Your use of it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take no
    responsibility if this program screws up your data, or any other
    thing on your or any other computer. I'm pretty sure it won't, but don't
    blame me if it does!
    
  - If you edit Magic or Life containers, it does not affect which containers
    are still available in the game. This means you can start a new game, change
    your containers to 8, and go find 4 more containers. DO NOT DO THIS! IT WILL
    CAUSE THE GAME TO CRASH! I may try to fix this in a future version.

    - His save state hacking guide for Nesticle was invaluable in creating this
      program. I would have had to do all the research myself otherwise.
